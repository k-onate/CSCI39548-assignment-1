        The Emperor Penguin is an animal where its wild variants are excluively found in Antarctica. Of all 18 penguin species currently known,
        it is the largest bird of them all, with them reaching heights of up to 4 feet. They can withstand the harsh climate of the Antarctic,
        where the temperatures can go beyond -50 degrees fahrenheit, and the winds can go beyond 100 miles per hour, by forming huge huddle groups.
        Through cooperation, these huddle groups rotate those who stay outside facing the brunt of the cold and wind with those inside. Their 
        diet consists mostly of Antarctic silverfish and krill, with them stocking up body fat reserves during the summer to endure the harsh
        winter, where they can go up to 4 months without eating.
