    <!-- Description of animal -->
    <p>
        Commonly found all over the Pacific Ocean, the Giant Pacific Octopus can be identified with its reddish-pink hue, 
        that fades into white on its underside. Expectedly, it has 8 arms that are covered in suction cups, allowing them to have
        insane grip strength to interact with its surroundings. They are solitary creatures, preferring to live their life alone
        in depths between shallow water levels or some 4900 feet, or even beyond. Their lifespans might seem short, with it ranging 
        between three to five years, but it actually has one of the longer lifespans compared to other octopus species, as it
        is more common for other octopuses to only live up to year maximum. Given the name, a full grown Giant Pacific Octopus can
        reach past 13 feet across and reach past 50 pounds.
