      As the name suggests, these mammals are primarily found in Africa.
      There are technically two species that share the name, the one currently
      pictured here is an African bush elephant. These elephants are the largest land animals
      to walk the earth, with the highest recorded height of them being 13 feet. They're
      also very social creatures, as they are known to live in family groups and shared
      bonds with each other.
